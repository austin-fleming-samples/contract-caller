# Contract Caller

Pulled from a larger project, the front and back end provide ways to interact with a counter contract.

## Instructions

This is a monorepo, so from this root directory:

- Install packages: `yarn install`
- Run frontend: `yarn frontend dev` -> localhost:3333
- Run backend: `yarn backend dev` -> localhost:8080/api/v1/

Was originally built to be tested against a Ropsten contract, so actual calls won't work.
